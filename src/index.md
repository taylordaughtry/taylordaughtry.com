I'm [@taylordaughtry](https://twitter.com/taylordaughtry), a software engineer, investor, and technology guy.

I write about a wide variety of topics, mostly related to technology. Topics include home automation, Laravel, PHP, code theory, and so forth. You might also see woodworking articles from time to time.
