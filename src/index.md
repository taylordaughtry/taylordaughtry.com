I'm [@taylordaughtry](https://twitter.com/taylordaughtry), software engineer, investor, and technology guy.

I write about a wide variety of topics, mostly related to technology. Topics include home automation, Laravel, PHP, code theory, and so forth. This site is brand-new, please excuse the current lack of content while I port old articles.
