In my time as a 'Lead' in one manner or another, I've come to realize there a few principles of Tech leadership that determine whether you'll be successful, or whether the project will come to a fiery end, sliding into &ldquo;complete&rdquo; by the seat of its pants.

Take them at face value, or pick them apart. In no particular order, I humbly present **principles of effective Tech leadership.**

## 1. Ask early, ask often

This has happened to all of us at one point or another:

You start a project with 'just a few implementation questions', planning to address these "when we're closer to that task"&hellip; but life happens. You realize weeks/months later that question _still_ wasn't answered, and now it's the eleventh hour; the week before launch. The client has to respond _right now_, or else you're going to have issues deploying/launching/fixing the issue. _This is not a good place to be_, obviously.

**Actionable tip:** Create a scheduled time each week where you're able to audibly chat with the client about anything project-related. _This_ is the appropriate time where you can slowly trickle questions as-needed to the client, ensuring they're getting you the information you need without the onslaught of heavily-technical questions they're probably not comfortable answering.

It's important to note that there's a balance here&mdash;if it's critical, send an email, or (preferably) hop on the phone. _Don't let waiting for answers delay work_, whether it's your work or other developers on the team.

## 2. Don't kill cockroaches

There's a great book titled _Killing Cockroaches_, by Tony Morgan.

In the book (you should read it), he mentions a responsibility he held while CEO of a rather-large company: anytime coworkers saw a cockroach, he'd be the one "chosen" to dispatch the intruder. Being CEO, there were far more critical tasks he could've been doing, but because he saw it as part of his _job_ to kill roaches, that's what he did.

In the same way, Tech Leads have a critical task: guide the project safely to completion on-time and on-budget. _You_ are the only one that can make this happen, because you're in charge of the technicals.

Sure, you _can_ write the markup. You _can_ add styling. You _can_ create the various fields in the CMS. But it's very likely that other devs on your team can _also_ do those things. 

What they _can't_ do is schedule hours to ensure consistent, effective development speed. What they _can't_ do is balance technical requirements with the reality of project budgets. What they _can't_ do is guide clients through the technical decisions they need to make while keeping them comfortable and not overwhelmed.

_Those_ are the things you should be doing.

A side benefit of effectively delegating tasks is that your knowledge is spread throughout your organization; it's no longer limited to the time you have in one day. Once other developers learn how to do that task, _you don't have to do it_, and you have that time free to do what _only you can do._

As in all things, there is a balance here, too. There are things in every project that could be done by others, but _should_ (or must) be done by you. If the project's budget doesn't allow for multiple other developers, obviously some development work will be your responsibility. However, be constantly aware and intentional about what you do, and what you delegate to others.

**Actionable tip:** What are you doing in your projects right now that could be (reasonably) done by others? Try delegating one task that you'd normally do to someone else on the team.

To summarize this principle: **only do what _only you_ can do.**
